A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/altitudems/pen/vpmeg.

 Based on princicples from Chris Coyer's excellent Perfect Full-Page Background Image. We just copy the src attr of each image in the slideshow and use it as the background-image for each slide. Then we can hide/remove the img tags.

This lets us do cool things like use CSS3 Transitions and easy rounded corners.
